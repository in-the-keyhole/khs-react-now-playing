## Example React Application

This repository contains an example React application that displays movies currently at the theater. It was built solely as an example of using React and is not intended to be used beyond the learning experience. 

The project utilizes the [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

## Comparison to Angular

As a learning tool, this application is in direct contrast to another application written with Angular 2. View that comparison application [here](https://github.com/in-the-keyhole/angular2-now-playing). We strive to be technology agnostic and this allows for a good learning comparison between the two popular approaches.
